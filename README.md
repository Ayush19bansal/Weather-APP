# Weather Forecast App

## Overview
The Weather Forecast App is a web application that provides real-time weather information based on the user's location or a manually input city. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it to the user. The app includes features such as dynamic weather icons, temperature conversion, humidity, visibility, and wind speed.

## Functionality
- **Real-Time Weather**: Fetches real-time weather data based on the user's current location or a manually input city.
- **Dynamic Weather Icons**: Displays weather conditions using dynamic weather icons based on the fetched data.
- **Temperature Conversion**: Provides temperature in Celsius.
- **Humidity**: Displays humidity percentage.
- **Visibility**: Shows visibility in miles.
- **Wind Speed**: Displays wind speed in kilometers per hour.

## Extra Packages Used
- `axios`: Used for making HTTP requests to fetch weather data from the API.
- `react-animated-weather`: Used for displaying dynamic weather icons.

## Learning from the Project
- **API Integration**: Learned how to integrate with external APIs (OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch real-time weather data.
- **State Management with useState and useEffect**: Learned how to manage state using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks in React.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Learned how to conditionally render components based on fetched data and handle errors.

## Future Improvements
- **Improved Error Handling**: Implement better error handling for cases where the API request fails or the user input is invalid.
- **Unit Conversion**: Allow users to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature display.
- **Extended Forecast**: Provide an extended forecast for multiple days instead of just the current weather.
- **User Preferences**: Allow users to save their preferred location and units for a personalized experience.
